# Hello!
<p>My name is Samuel Estrada, and I am currently studying a major in Industrial Economics. 
I love spending my free time learning programming as a tool to enhance my skills... </p>

<hr>

## ðŸ”§ Right now I am practicing python for data science, but I'm also into web design...

**The latest project I made** called <strong>FAJS B</strong> 
  <ul>
    <li>ðŸ”¹ It is a website I built for an e-commerce project during my marketing course in college </li>
    <li>ðŸ”¹ The foundation for this project was the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>
My background in Industrial Economics has led me to develop strong skills in econometrics, and I have been actively using programming languages like Python and R to apply econometric techniques. I am passionate about data science. I would like to design robust models, and I am fascinated by all the valuable information that can be extracted from data.
</p>
<p>
I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge in this field, am also particularly interested in learning SQL and similar tools for data manipulation.
