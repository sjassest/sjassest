# Hello!
<p>My name is Samuel Estrada, and I am currently studying a major in Industrial Economics. 
I love spending my free time learning programming as a tool to enhance my skills, and at the same time, I enjoy learning new things</p>

<hr>

## ðŸ”§ Right now I am practicing and learning data science, but I'm also into web design...

- **The latest project I made** called <strong>FAJS B</strong> 
  - <ul>
    <li>ðŸ”¹ It is a website I built for an e-commerce project during my marketing course in college </li>
    <li>ðŸ”¹ The foundation for this project was the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>
My background in Industrial Economics has led me to develop strong skills in econometrics, and I have been actively using programming languages like Python and R to apply econometric techniques. I am passionate about data analysis and have been focusing on building robust models and extracting meaningful insights from data.
</p>
<p>
I am eager to continue expanding my knowledge in this field and am particularly interested in learning SQL and similar tools for data manipulation. I believe these skills will enhance my ability to manage and analyze large datasets effectively.
